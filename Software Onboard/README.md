## About the libraries

As said in the README on this repo main page, my libraries can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Miguel-San/Arduino-Libraries">my Arduino Libraries repo</a>.
The rest of the libraries used on theese scripts are included with Arduino or are listed with a link to the original repo (with the author's name) below:
